# Computational-Intelligence
A repository containing all the projects of the "Computational Intelligence" course from ECE DUTh.

Development of algorithms and techniques for solving complex problems, using Matlab tools and libraries. Each directory has a file developed in Matlab in [.mlx] format that describes the process.
