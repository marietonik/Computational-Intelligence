# Computational-Intelligence
A repository containing all the projects of the "Computational Intelligence" course from ECE DUTh.

Development of algorithms and techniques for solving complex problems, using Matlab tools and libraries. each directory has a file developed in Matlab in [.mlx] format.

* Neural network as a machine learning algorithm for computing results of function given.

* Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection.

* Fuzzy logic is a type of mathematical logic that deals with approximate rather than precise reasoning.
